                <h2>Desire to Create</h2>
                <p class="lead">Since he was a young man, the drive to make and fix was one of his defining traits and
                    desires.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Born in 1969, life growing up was different and challenging. Constant fixing of his
                    children's toys and efforts around the house
                    started giving voice to desire to create, in any way possible. From engine mechanics, botany,
                    farming and building,
                    it seems nothing was impossible for him. And all of it self-taught, learning by trial and error. It
                    seems he only needed to see something to
                    be able to recreate it or make it better. And painting was, and still is, one of his many passions.

                <p class="mb-0">After 10 years of creating stunning paintings, recognition came and first exibit was set
                    up.
                    It took a long while to talk him into it, as he didn't create for recognition, fame or money. It was
                    and still is, a passion.
                    The exibit was an overwhelming success, not to mention how proud and validated the artist felt.

                    every day,
                    the knowledge that was created out of pure will is a testament to human spirit. Someone to look up
                    to and admire.
