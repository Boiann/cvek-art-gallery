# CVEK ART GALLERY

Cvek Art Gallery is a Project 5 for Code Institute Full-stack development program: E-Commerce Applications. It is a B2C platform, gallery/store where the user can purchase painting/s, with added frame and discount options. Using mainly Django, a Python back-end development framework and Bootstrap, front-end (CSS) framework wired up to Stripe, this project was brought to life. Made with passion and meant to honor my father whose abilities, persistence and the thirst for learning keep inspiring.

## **Project Overview**

Cvek Art Gallery was conceptualized a couple of months ago, even before Project 4 was. As the end Project and its requirements were known ahead of time, it was decided to honor Mr. Cvek's painting capabilities and their inherent beauty. It is a B2C (business-to-consumer) platform, gallery/store where the user can view all of the paintings currently for sale. As the paintings for sale are one of a kind, the quantity selector and model were replaced by an option to buy frame/s with the painting. 
Also, the discount on multiple purchases is a nice way of attracting new and keeping old customers. This project was realized using Django, Javascript, jQuery, Python, CSS3, Bootstap and HTML5, wired up to Stripe payment platform.

**Note for testing the checkout functionality:**

The site will not process an actual card payment and no charges will be collected through site and/or Stripe. Also, no orders will be fulfilled or delivered.
To keep your personal information secure, it is advised to use Stripe test Visa card:
* Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
* MM/YY: Any future date in the format MM/YY
* CVC: Any 3 numbers
* ZIP: Any 5 numbers

* **HINT**: When Payment field is selected, just enter 424242... until the end!

### **Project Goals**

 * Develop CAG website using Django and Bootstrap frameworks, wire up to Stripe
 * Present the website in a clean and easy to understand manner
 * Keep good UX principles regarding layout/colors/interaction
 * Robust Python code without issues/bugs
 * Fully responsive, interactive and with feedbacks
