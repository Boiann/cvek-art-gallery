## **Bugs**

### **Known Bugs**

* No known bugs present in the project (disclaimer; that doesn't mean there are none) at the time of writing this readme/testing.

### **Solved Bugs**

There were many 'small' bugs that had to be dealt with during the development of the project. Most of them were squashed by doing a quick [Google](https://google.com/ "Google home page") search and using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow home page") to find relevant solutions.

Two of the biggest bugs were with Stripe webhooks and in later development, connection to AWS. The webhook bug is documented through GitHub Issues, the AWS one was not unfortunately, mainly because it caused quite a bit of panic being so close to submission date.

- Image format not recognized - [BUG NO. 1](https://github.com/Boiann/cvek-art-gallery/issues/83).

- Implementing Subcategories into the project proved to be bit more difficult than it seemed but it worked out in the end. The remaining issue that was subsequently removed from the project was to get the current subcategory selected display as a nav-link below the navbar. The same implementation worked for categories, but for subcategories it displayed either all of the subcategories, or none at all. A lot of effort was put into this trying to solve it but due to the project deadline it was decided to leave it out, along with current category nav link as not to present links for categories but not for subcategories.

- First major bug was encountered while implementing Stripe and its webhooks. It took multiple days and tries for this to be solved, and it took away time from further development. The code was updated and reworked multiple times because there was lack of attention to details and testing scope on the developer's part. That bug lead directly to other one with the database. After overloading the code with `print()` statements, it was fixed. More about this bug in [BUG NO. 2](https://github.com/Boiann/cvek-art-gallery/issues/93).

- Forcing sku as unique identifier instead of painting_id was a mistake in retrospect, this caused additional time spent when reworking the code to use painting_id. This change necessity became apparent when trying to implement adding new paintings as admin. When using SKU-s, when SKU field was left empty when submitting new painting, nothing worked because SKU was missing and not automatically generated, and painting_id is.

- Search functionality was not working as it should, returning nothing if searched term was category/subcategory, which was solved and fixed quickly.

- Connecting the deployed Heroku site with AWS was, in short, a nightmare causing actual physical consequences. Brought on by, again, lack of attention to details. This caused so much upset that it was not documented, and by the time it was fixed it was decided it will be talked about in this section. This was stemming from the fact that a similar issue actually happened, and it was not considered to be possible again. And the fact that mentor and tutors were unable to help with the issue.
  - AWS bucket creation and wiring-up steps were followed diligently, but media files were not showing up no matter what.
  - A lot of trial and unfortunate errors were made trying to fix this, reflected in the number of commits submitted on this issue (form 'AWS Deployment' to 'Fix favicon img path, delete previous loadstatic files')
  - After seeking help with the images not loading, it was realized what the mistake was, not using template tags for logo. The paintings images not showing up was still an issue
  - Looking up on Slack, Stack-Overflow, Google, asking the mentor and tutors did not help
  - It was assumed the issue was in `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` config var in Heroku, and that it somehow didn't connect/wire up with AWS
  - Slack community members suggested that `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` should actually NOT be removed for the first time deployment connected with AWS, this was later looked into and the issue is actually having the debug mode set to true, and that was creating issues for some people
  - Trying to run collectstatic and 'fixing' static settings in settings.py only made things worse, lack of experience made it worse still
  - Finally, the mistake was caught - because of multiple projects in GitPod workspace each project had it's own `DATABSE_URL`, renamed to `DATABSE_URL_CAG` for this project. This was an issue before with Stripe, because `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` set to general user scope (Boiann/*) was returning webhooks from both Boutique Ado + CAG. This was caught early, fixed quickly, and promise was made to oneself - 'Don't do this again'. But it did happen again, because database Heroku Config var was using `DATABSE_URL`. Changing that config var to `DATABSE_URL_CAG` solved issues with media files.

 - Sitemap bug - when sitemap was created for the first time, it was over 2500 lines long. At first, this was thought to be an issue with missing robots.txt file. After that was added, the sitemap still returned very large. Other projects were tested to see their sitemap scope, all returned ok. After Google, Slack and Stack Overflow check, tutoring was contacted, yielding no clear instruction/advice. Upon closer examination, it was noticed that add/edit/delete painting links were crawled, which only a superuser can do. The issue was that the html presented no edit/delete buttons for regular user (superuser check) but the buttons were still present in the hidden modal. Adding superuser check within the modal itself solved this issue and returned sitemap of normal size.
